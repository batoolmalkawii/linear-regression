# Linear Regression 

In this project, we perform exploratory analysis by using **Linear Regressions** on the **Kaggle** [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/testpython/linear-regression).

The Notebook included the following:

    1. Load the data you receive into a Pandas DataFrame.
    2. Show the first five rows of the data set.
    3. Show the description and the info of the data set.
    4. Using a regression model, split your data into train and test data.
    5. Fit your training split to the regression model.
    6. Show your regression modelâ€™s score.
    7. Draw three conclusions from your regression model.

Packages:
    * `Pandas`.
    * `Numpy`.
    * `scikit-learn`.
    * `Jupyterlab`.
